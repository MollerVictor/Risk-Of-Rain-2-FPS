# Risk-Of-Rain-2-FPS

First Person Mod for Risk of Rain 2.

This is a proof of concept and will not be updated for newer versions of RoR2. 
So feel free to make your own version more polished version of this.

# Install
Find the RoR2 install folder and go to "Risk of Rain 2\Risk of Rain 2_Data\Managed" and replace Assembly-CSharp.dll with the one you downloaded. Make sure you make a copy of the original one, so you can go back when you don't want first person anymore.
